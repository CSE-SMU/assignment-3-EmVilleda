## What's your name?
Emely Villeda-Principe


## How difficult was this assignment?
Part's 1 and 2 were managable once I was able to find the proper resources and example. Part 3 took me forever even though it was just a few tweaks.

More emphasis on SASS training and example.


## Any other comments?
Bootstrap is pretty awesome.
